# MoneyBall-Project-With-R
Here, I solved MoneyBall Project. It is a classic project, where in 2002, Oakland had challange to find the replacement of his top 3 players who left the team, with the third lowest salary budget out of 30 teams.

I worked on 3 new statistics to find out best players in low budget. I found out the left plyers and replaced them with new 3 best players(on the basis of new statistics) within the given budget threshold.

I used merge, subset, dplyr library, ggplot2 library to execute the project.
